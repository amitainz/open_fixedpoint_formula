The Open Fixed-point Formula Repository
=======================================

This repository contains python code and extensive documentation for an implementation of the open fixed-point formula.

For more about the what this program is all about, how to use it, and the math behind it, visit `<https://amitainz.github.io/open_fixedpoint_formula/>`_

If you want to just tinker a bit with the program without having to install anything, point your browser to `<https://repl.it/@amitainz/Open-Fixed-point-Formula>`_. You can execute the main.py file and then start playing with it.

If you'd like to run the code locally, you will need a python 3 environment with the future, sympy and mpmath modules installed.
